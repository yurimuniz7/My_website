<p align="justify">Hi, I'm currently a PhD student of physics at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), where I study light-matter interaction related phenomenon. My main research areas are nano-optics, nanophotonics, plasmonics, and bidimensional materials. I also have great interest in the world of data science and machine learning, and have been working hard to improve my skills in this field.</p>

<p align="justify">In my free time I enjoy playing video games (mostly RPGs and strategy games), listen to music (heavy metal and folk), play the guitar, and also read about different topics. The purpose of this website is to show not only my recent projects and knowledge of data science, but also to make public all the work that I've done in physics. I truly believe that sharing your work online has great potential to help others, who may find value on the content you create.</p>
