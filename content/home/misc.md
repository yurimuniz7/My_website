<p align="justify">If you are interested in knowing what books, papers, and other materials had the biggest influence on my career, I prepared this section for you. Of course I could highlight many other influences here, but I will rather give only a brief list about physics and machine learning.</p>

**Physics**

- [**A Brief History of Time**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time), by *Stephen Hawking*. I read this book when I was at High School and it was very important to develop my interest and open my mind to physics.

- **Carlos Farina's lessons**. Farina, my academic advisor since 2015, is well known for being passionate about physics and teaching, and is very good at motivating his students. It was no different with me, who became fascinated about the quantum vacuum effects and other topics. A glimpse of the things he used to talk about can be found in this [awesome review paper about the Casimir effect](http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/files/v36_1137.pdf) and in this [talk about Christiaan Huygens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkCN0_1dzzM) (In portuguese).

- [**Photons and atoms: introduction to quantum electrodynamics**](https://www.amazon.com.br/Photons-Atoms-Introduction-Quantum-Electrodynamics/dp/0471184330), by *Cohen-Tannoudji*. This is a more technical book about quantum electrodynamics and atom-photon interactions. I recommend it to any physicist who wants to have a deep understanding of the theory behind light-matter interactions.

**Machine Learning**

- [**Gabriel Schleder**](https://gschleder.github.io/) [**machine learning tutorial**](https://github.com/gschleder/MLtutorial). This tutorial was presented at the 2019 Autumn Meeting of the Brazilian Society of Physics (EOSBF) and was the first contact that I had with machine learning (besides hearing about it from others). It is based on his [very nice paper about machine learning applied to materials science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7639/ab084b/pdf).

- [**AlphaStar**](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii): [**the artificial intelligence made by google that beat StarCraft II top players**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.epdf?shared_access_token=eeinxBhKk8Z48E6x6FHZVdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PSZcPzJFGNAZhOlk4deBCKav0uumYG1ZCvYjtJGSnL-x-42q3C4KrjbWLIOQpxrJaIK4LbpApBj-NfrJ4LKlrAr9U1vpqf2aPrrhSoGwhs1w%3D%3D). For those who don't know, I'm a huge fan of the real time strategy game StarCraft II. I was very impressed when I saw [AlphaStar winning 1v1 matches against professional players like TLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpRPfidTjDA), which pushed me to learn more about the subject.

- [**A self-adaptive microwave cloak using Deep Learning**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340110736_Deep-learning-enabled_self-adaptive_microwave_cloak_without_human_intervention). Since metasurface cloaks are related to my research (see for instance [this work from my co-advisor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5022.pdf)), this paper made me realize that machine learning can be applied in all areas of science and technology.

- [**Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R**](https://www.amazon.com.br/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-103/dp/1461471370), by *Gareth James*. Since I have a strong academic background, I had a much better time with this book than others. I find amazing that every statistical concept and machine learning algorithm in this book is presented in a very clear way. I also recommend the [Andrew Ng machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?) available at Coursera as an excellent introduction to the subject.
