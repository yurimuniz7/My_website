<p align="justify">Hi, I'm a data scientist at GAVB consulting. I currently work in the optimization team, where I try to help the business decision making of GAVB customers through data analysis, mathematical optimization, and machine learning models. I'm also a PhD student of physics at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), where I study light-matter interaction related phenomenon. My main research areas are nano-optics, nanophotonics, plasmonics, and bidimensional materials.</p>

<p align="justify">In my free time I enjoy playing video games (mostly RPGs and strategy games), listen to music (heavy metal and folk), play the guitar, and also read about different topics. The purpose of this website is to make public my projects and study materials of data science, and also the work I've done in physics. I truly believe that sharing your work online has great potential to help others, who may find value on the content you create.</p>
