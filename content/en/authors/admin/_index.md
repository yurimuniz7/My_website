<p align="justify">Hi, I'm a data scientist at Grupo Boticário (GB), where I'm part of the Revenue Growth Management (RGM) team. In my day-to-day work I participate in projects that aim to improve pricing of GB products with data analysis and statistical models. I'm also a PhD candidate of physics at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), where I study light-matter interaction related phenomenon. My main research areas are nano-optics, nanophotonics, plasmonics, and two-dimensional materials.</p>

<p align="justify">In my free time I enjoy playing video games (mostly RPGs and strategy games), listen to music (and learn a little bit), and also read about different topics. The purpose of this website is to make public some of my study materials in data science and the work I've done in physics. I truly believe that freely sharing your work online has great potential to help others, who may find value on the content you create.</p>
