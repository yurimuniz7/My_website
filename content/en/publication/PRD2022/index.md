abstract: <p align="justify"> It is well known that the vicinities of an atomic system may substantially affect its radiative properties. In this work, we consider the influence of a cosmic string background in the spontaneous emission of an excited atom. We start by computing the one-photon spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter, which is a narrow band process, and then we analyze the more complex case of the two-photon spontaneous emission, which is a broadband and much richer phenomenon. In the former case, we analyze not only the behavior of the decay rate with the distance from the atom to the string, but also with the deficit angle associated with the cosmic string metric. In the latter case, we show that the spectral distribution of the emitted photons is substantially affected by the cosmic string background.</p>
