abstract: Um breve resumo desse trabalho pode ser encontrado no [site da SBF](http://www.sbfisica.org.br/v1/home/index.php/pt/destaque-em-fisica/1191-nanoestruturas-plasmonicas-podem-emitir-fotons-para-tecnologias-quanticas). <p align="justify"> The ability to harness light-matter interactions at the few-photon level plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies. Single photons—the most elementary states of light—can be generated on demand in atomic and solid state emitters. Two-photon states are also key quantum assets, but achieving them in individual emitters is challenging because their generation rate is much slower than competing one-photon processes. We demonstrate that atomically thin plasmonic nanostructures can harness two-photon spontaneous emission, resulting in giant far field two-photon production, a wealth of resonant modes enabling tailored photonic and plasmonic entangled states, and plasmon-assisted single-photon creation orders of magnitude more efficient than standard one-photon emission. We unravel the two-photon spontaneous emission channels and show that their spectral line shapes emerge from an intricate interplay between Fano and Lorentzian resonances. Enhanced two-photon spontaneous emission in two-dimensional nanostructures paves the way to an alternative efficient source of light-matter entanglement for on-chip quantum information processing and free-space quantum communications.</p>
